Okay, thanks for taking an interest in my offline Star Wars LCG deck builder!  

PLEASE NOTE: This deck builder is only meant for the players in the Star Wars LCG
community WHO OWN THE ACTUAL CARDS.  The Star Wars IP belongs to Disney and 
Lucasfilm LTD.  Star Wars The Card Game is copyrighted material of FFG.  The

The Deck Editor:

The deck editor is where you will do your main deck construction.  If you click
on a row in the grid, you will see the card appear in the card view window.  
Please note that you can expand/contract the windows within the form by left-
clicking and dragging the 'separators' within the form.  

YOU MUST SELECT A FACTION CARD before you'll be allowed to enter any other cards
into your deck.  They are located at the top of the grid when the grid is in 
the Card ID# sort order (ascending).

To put an objective set into your deck, double-click on a card within the grid.
That will put a single copy of the entire objective set into your decks (both 
Objective deck and Command deck).  To remove an objective set from your decks,
simply double-click on a card within the 'Deck view' window (lower-left) and 
all cards from that single set will be removed from your decks.  

If you click on a card from within the 'Deck view' window, that row will be 
highlighted within the grid and the card will be shown in the 'Card view' window.

The 'Deck view' window shows your current decks broken up by card types.  Your 
Objective deck is contained within the Objectives view component.  Your Command 
deck is all the others (Units, Enhancements, Events, Fate Cards, and Missions).
I designed it this way to give you a better idea of how your Command deck breaks 
down within these card types.

If you click on a 'header' within any of the card type views (i.e. the title or 
the '====' characters) the view will expand/contract to allow you to see all the 
cards within it's view.  Experiment with it a little and I think you'll soon get
the hang of it.

The 'Grid' can be sorted by using the grid filter buttons which are located above
the actual grid.  A bit of experimentation with the filters will most likely 
get you what you want.

You can also right-click on the grid to view an entire objective set.  Right-
clicking on the window closes it again.

Also, you can include your own card scans if you like.  Simply highlight a card
in the grid and then drag the image file and drop it onto the form.  You should
see your scan replace the prior one.  The program will save the location of 
the new image in the Cards.txt file along with that card's other information.

The Deck Stats tab:

Not much to say here.  Just a breakdown of whatever current cards you have in 
your Command deck, whether that be 8 sets or 10 or more sets.  At the bottom of 
this tab if you scroll down you'll find the opening hand selector / objective flop.  
This is just there to give you an idea of what kind of opening hands you would 
draw with your current deck build or what you'd see for your opening 4-card 
objective flop.

I'd really appreciate any feedback/suggestions you may have for the program if you 
use it.  I like to do this type of coding on the side as a hobby and I like to try
and make improvements that people want.

Thanks,
Scott
