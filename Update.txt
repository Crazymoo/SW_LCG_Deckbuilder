 - Added Galactic Ambitions
 - Reworked Octgn.txt and Cards.txt files so that ALL cards now match-up to

Update - version 1.0.5.1 (05/31/2016)
 - Added Press the Attack Force Pack
 - Fixed a bug where similar names of card titles (e.g. Maw of Madness and Maw)
   was causing the wrong card to appear on the Objective Flop on the Deck
   Stats tab.
   
   

Update - version 1.0.4.1 (xx/xx/xxxx)
 - Added Grid Filters.  Top row of buttons filters the Faction column and the 
   2nd row filters the Card Type column.  The last row contains the dropdown 
   to filter the grid by Released Force Pack or Deluxe Box.
   
 - New funtionality!  Clicking the right-mouse button anywhere in the card
   grid will open up a Set View window.  The set in the window will be the six
   cards belonging to the set of where the cursor was in the grid when the 
   right-mouse button was clicked.
   
   The window can be resized to make it bigger to be able to better view the
   cards in the set. 
   
   To exit the Set View window, either click the 'X' button or right-mouse click
   anywhere within the window.



Update - version 1.0.3.5 (04/07/2016)

- Removed the 'Export Decks' and 'Check My Deck!' tabs.

- Program is now able to Load/Save Octgn files.  Makes it easier to 'point' the 
  applications directory to wherever you have your Octgn files saved...load the
  file in, swap some objective sets around, and then re-save the deck as an 
  Octgn file.  Makes changing your Octgn decks ultra-easy.
  
- Slight change to the Load/Save methods of Text decks.  The Format the 
  application now uses for Text Decks (.txt) can be opened directly into any 
  text editor.  From there you can send the list directly to a printer or even 
  just copy/paste the list to an email or post it to a forum thread!  No text
  editing or formatting is needed (unless you don't like my format). :)

- NOTE: If you've downloaded the application before, then you only need to go
  to the Google Drive and download/install the Update_v1.0.3.5.exe file.  It's 
  significantly smaller than the complete SW_LCG_Deckbuilder_Setup.exe file due
  to the lack of the 1200 image files in the installer.
  
  But if you're a 'first-timer' to the application, download/install
  SW_LCG_Deckbuilder_Setup.exe (~487 MB)
